# CHANGELOG Folder

The purpose of this folder is to keep a record of all changes made since the last release. This has been done to eliminate conflicts which arise from multiple developers all directly contributing to the CHANGELOG.md file.

At the point of releasing a new version to production, the contents of the subfolders will be combined into the CHANGELOG.md and the original folders deleted in preparation for the following release.
